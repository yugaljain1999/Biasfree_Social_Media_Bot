0,h02cjsf,you might not like my advice but you might benefit from a therapist. i think now there are a shit ton of online therapists. so that'll make it easier on you. good luck,||
1,h02cg0j,making genuine friends is hard for sure.,||
2,h02cdzb,"yeah i can relate to you very well. I used to have really bad social anxiety in the past. it takes a shit ton of patience and practice to learn to be 'social'. trust me, everyone struggles at one level or another. do you work out? start working out. therapy also helps. maybe seek out a therapist who specializes in social anxiety?(or someone who can guide you on xyz). i also recommend listen to youtube audiobooks on 'stoicism' to me at least has helped lower my Anxiety about overthinking stuff. i hope i helped a bit. in reality, you have to work on your whole you and it will take a shit ton of work. but as long as you keep at it, you'll be happier with who you are. also celebrate every tiny progress you made each day. take care",

6,h02bzin,"ty for the advice!! as for them being grateful knowing I'm back, I have not yet said anything so they don't know I'm here :(",||
7,h02bwkt,"About the get to talk to them problem: Just greet them and tell them what you want and feel and how hard it is for you to do the first step. It sounds like they are more grateful to know u r back and that you want it to stay that way than to know what happened. 

And about the issue with the reasoning: If you cant talk about the reason right now tell them how u feel and ask for some time to figure it out. Maby ask them about how they felt and what they we're thinking if it does not pull u down. If it does tell them that it would not be good for your mental health to talk about what happened right now and ask them to wait for the time when u feel ready. 

Maby its not the fastest way to clear the air but for me it sounds like the most selfcared way.",
8,h02btkh,well you got a few more years but maybe once you’re out of school you can try it just for a summer. you can meet people who think in the same realm as you with similar interests. there are genuine people out there but i’ll tell you from my experience i certainly didn’t find them in high school. i hope things start looking up for you , #151;||

13,h02bkpm,"You'll get there, to the point where you're like ""whoa, I'm pretty awesome! if only I knew that when I was 23, those were difficult years of figuring out stuff"".

Sounds like you have good relationship with your mom. In such a way that if you did ask her ""am I disappointment? she'd likely be sad that the thought have crossed your mind""

If you have everything figured out before age 25. You're beyond superstar, not many do. The 'statistics' don't matter. Perception does.

You may see a lot of people going to college, and finding jobs and so on, and it 'seems' like they have it figured out. Some might have, but rarely. Most are figuring it out just like you are. And they're super stressed about it too.

Rarely do college student graduate and think ""well, now time to start my job, and figure out life"". College is just an extension of high-school in sense of 'reality'. Grad school can be more difficult and require more responsibility, sure.

But a grad student have no experience (if they never worked before) when compared to a minimum wage worker of 4 years, whom have more perceptible reality to what life is actually like after schooling.

You're smart. People may say otherwise, for whatever reason they may need to. But you're smart. Every child is smart, every student is smart. It's only when they're not trying that it's quite a miss opportunity.

If you earnestly tried very hard, and are continuing to give your best effort when you can, you're smart, and most of us are rooting for you to make it through these tough years of self-discovery.

There is nothing gained from putting other people down based on standards. Everyone have their own unique set of passionate skills which they will develop. Whether it's helping people, whether it's making machinery, whether it's preserving wildlife, etc etc. Most people in life, really wants to find this 'passion'. But some don't find it until their late 40s.

My college years were 'mehs'. I thought it was quite boring, and I was quite delusional regarding ""if I don't graduate college, I'm going to be a failure forever"". But then I saw the silly people whom were in classes with me, and I thought, maybe I'll be alright... or at least... I don't think I belong here...  My academics were 'stellars', but my heart wasn't in it.

It's not for everyone. Don't get me wrong, if a person desires to be an engineer, it's likely college or some form of learning will be for them. However, the way 'college' are set up, especially the book prices which gets renew every other year because MONEY. It makes no sense to me. The cost of education is 'so high', and I don't mean just money. You're buying into a perception. A perception that everyone needs to pass college or they will amount to little.

The 'truth' is, or in least, my personal truth is that personality and individual knowledge are 'more essential'. Meaning, everyone can go to college to learn how molecules interact with one another and so on. But how is that useful if the person themselves lack healthy perception of the world?

You sound like you're going through a tough time. It will get better, most likely anyway.  
Some support would go a long way if you're stressed out a lot though.

Talk to your trust ones, like your mom, unless she's really stress right now too or something.

Usually, our parents really want to be there for us. and even if they don't give any good advice, it's quite comforting to just talk to someone about what you're thinking about and the surmount of pressure you're feeling.

At the end of the day, do you like you? Do you enjoy being with yourself and so on. If right now you're thinking ""no, I'm ugly, I'm a disappointment, etc etc"". No one can change your thoughts in way.

But there was a time when you thought ""I'm so awesome! I'm a super star!"" until others and the world came around and knocked you down with 'standards'.

The standards are just too high, if everyone can somehow met them, we'd all be 'well educated'.

A good healthy standard to go by is

""did you earnestly put in hard work today?""  
If not, that can be alright if you need some time to just relax, and get the stress level down before you're back on the horse. Just don't be one of those lazy millennial whom believes money and success will fall into their laps by making a few youtube videos.

""did you treat yourself kindly today?""

It can be healthy to self-criticize like ""I could have done better at this, or I've made a mistake here"". but everyone makes mistakes in way. Did you genuinely make a mistake and feel bad and know what to do next time? if so, perhaps it's time to stop feeling so bad about just being a regular human going through their early twenties.

""did you treat others kindly today?""

Forget college degrees and so on. This fundamental 'healthy standard' should be the hallmark. But there's so much ego in academia, there's so much ego in the workplace and so on.

If you're worried about if you're going to be a productive, healthy individual amongst society one day or not. It's likely you'll get there. But it's going to be way more difficult if you're stressed over things that 'don't truly even matter'.

They only appear to matter because young students are drilled with the idea of ""you want to be smart and successful and not a loser and not make everyone think lowly of you? graduate college now! don't' forget to buy all our expensive book that can't ever be recused after two years because we keep printing new one because capitalism! (Hint, buy used book off amazon. The best professors wouldn't require student to have their textbook anyway, if a professor SPECFICALLY calls someone out for not having 'their brand new textbook' it's such a red flag.)

I've realize within my second year that I didn't need any text book >.> the professor did their job well enough in which I just wrote down notes in class. what a college hack. don't buy book, save it for grocery.",

16,h02biv3,"Psychotic episodes are usually a symptom of an underlying disease, most commonly schizophrenia, but other diseases can have them as well. So you should try to find out what the underlying disease is in your case (with the help of your therapist and doctors). Is there any history of schizophrenia or something like that in your family?

I haven't had any psychotic symptoms myself, but I've been to the psych ward and met some schizophrenic patients there. The stories are quite unique, but it seems really common to feel like things just have to be a certain way or that you know a deeper truth that nobody else can see. The aggression and feces on walls or other places they shouldn't be are sadly also quite common.

You have a therapist, and a doctor to prescribe you the necessary meds, that's a good place to start. You could ask them to explain in more details what psychosis really means. Or, if you want to explore more on your own without feeling pressured to share more details, you can ask them for book recommendations.

Your life certainly changes a lot now because you will always have to stay on the meds and you know what psychosis can do to a person. But it's not necessarily ruined. You can find new priorities, new hobbies and a new purpose for yourself. It may be different from what you expected, but that happens to a hell of a lot of people who have life ""ruining"" (or better: changing) experiences. You may have a bad disease that keeps you from being the person you thought you would be, but you have yet to get to know the person you can become now.

(Since you seem to like journaling and have unique experiences, you could even consider writing books about your experiences. A book from a psychotic patient's perspective could be really helpful to future patients, their loved ones, therapists and doctors. But that's just a thought, it's probably too early to think about that for you.)",

23,h02b190,"Hmm well everyone is different. It's been some years since I realised there's no meaning to it all, and I haven't craved any meaning ever since, or wished there was one.

What kind of meaning do you crave? Maybe you can find or think of your own one. I have a friend who doesn't believe in higher powers or meaning or anything like that. However, he has always wanted to become a scientist, and he's a bioinformatitian in a cancer research lab now. He's found his meaning/purpose in his work.",

But, what if you actually, just for yourself, wrote down the absolute opposites of this. And you did that every day for some time. It doesn't actually matter that you don't believe it and that it makes you cringe and a little angry even. It still works, slowly but surely.

\---

I will be happy. I am fucking happy!

I am satisfied with myself. And I will be more and more.

People love me. And I'll work on it so there's more love in the world.

I am can have love and happiness, every day. Just as the next guy.

//Deserving something does not mean you'll get it.

\- Just don't say that. Replace this with something else. Like - I will work every day towards my goals. Even a tiny little bit.

Good things happen, TO EVERYONE. I'm no special snowflake.

//I do not deserve this suffering, and suicide is the only way I have to take matters into my own hands.

I have suffered and have won. I will always win. I will always fight. And it will become easier and easier. Until I'm a master slayer.

\---

I'd do this in your own words for a couple of days, or as long as you can go.

Doing affirmations like this has helped me incredibly. It just did and I can swear, it at least won't do any damage. Your brain (anyone's) is not that smart. He won't know that you're lying to him when you're thinking  ""Jesus I'm so happy! How did I even become this happy? I don't know! But I am!"" Sure it doesn't work instantaneously, but actually faster than I thought.

I really have found that even when I say these positive things sarcastically, they still kinda sorta work.

Sorry to have annoyed you with my bullcrap ""wisdom"". It is just something that helps me.

75,h02762x,"This just sounds like you’ve been thinking too much. But also, I get your point. Ignorance is bliss, but trust me. The smarter you get, the harder it gets and the stronger that feeling is. 

And you’re not dumb for not knowing how to get out of depression. It’s not about intelligence at all. Thinking you’re dumb for having a chemical imbalance in your brain that makes you sad is literally the chemical imbalance making you think that. You get me?",

93,h025usa,"That's definitely true but sometimes people actually care about why you're dry or seem to close yourself off. Maybe they'd like to ask a bit but are afraid of pushing you further away or bothering you. I mean I can only say this because I've been in therapy for a year and a half but I feel like that's one of the big things I've learned. 

I'll give you a suggestion about what helped me when I felt that way, feel free to try or not :D also let me know how it goes if you do!

If you're with other people and catch yourself ""bringing the vibe down"", closing off, being dry or something along those lines, try telling someone about how you feel. Don't go all in right away with a massive depressive rant but maybe let them know you're feeling a bit down and stuff like that. It's crazy how different people's reaction is compared to what you expect (or at least I expected), people are almost always supportive and a deeper friendship might start, once people see you opening up they also feel more comfortable doing the same.",

96,h025nvq,"I get this same feeling a lot. The only thing I can say is, we're already here anyways, so might as well say fuck it and do the things you want to do, even if it seems futile to just barely start now. Like a ""what else is there to do?"" thing. We're stuck with life, but we can at least get a kick or two out of it until we die eventually.",||
97,h025lsj,Kinda relatable. Though I don't bite my tongue because I'm pretty sure people want to get rid of me the moment we meet so it's not worth it. No matter how long someone stays in touch with me I will always believe they secretly dislike me.,||
