2,g9w8s8u,Because Tom Wills was a wizard," in New England and he had been the best of them all his entire career. It was not only because he played like that but because they were so great, it made him feel special.

6,g9w7o4o,"All I know is I put my faith in Boston Scott on two of my fantasy teams - one decimated by injury and the other being the week where I had 4 different players on bye and he did not disappoint. Granted it took until the final minute of the game to make his pick up from the waiver look like a genius move, but the end result is still the same - I’m alive and well in both of those leagues. Richard Rodgers was not a bad emergency pick up at TE when Ertz went down.",

68,g9vjohr,"We just had a conversation about how there should be a ""toilet bowl"" (working title) where the bottom ranked teams play for the 1st round draft pick. The Super Bowl has been pretty boring for the last few years. But the bottom ranked teams will be more interesting to watch because it will be more chaotic and the outcome harder to predict.

And then it could be like a Mardi Gras in the stands where people wear funny costumes and just kind of get made fun of by the announcers. Turn it into an irreverent bacchanal of bottom-feeding and sub-optimal football.

A game like baseball, when played at the highest level (a no-hitter), is basically two guys playing catch for 3 hours. But if the teams both have flaws and weaknesses there will be more action on the field. The same goes for NFL. Two teams who don't have the best defense will have more touchdowns. Two teams with ""pretty good"" quarterbacks will throw interceptions and get sacked.",
