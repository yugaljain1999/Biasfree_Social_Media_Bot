>There is no such thing as the Aryan race.

I never claimed there was - this is once again a strawman. People migrated from the central Asian steppe to India, bringing their language with them. They called themselves 'Aryan'. This has nothing to do with an Aryan 'race' lol.

Of course there's no steppe DNA in skeletons from Rakhigarhi, that site long predates the arrival of steppe people in India. Once again, who are you arguing with? It certainly isn't me.

I'm sorry, but none of your papers or propaganda sites address the presence of Steppe DNA in all ethnic groups within India. 

And it also doesn't address the linguistic issue - even if there were almost no steppe DNA among Indians, the relationship of Sanskrit to other IE languages is more than clear.",

*Dravida Narrative* : There is no mention of the word 'Aryan' in Indic scriptures. The word Dravida was coined when Adi Shankara was going around the country on the mission to re-convert the then Buddhist Bharat to Sanatan Dharma by having Shastra-Arths with top Buddhist Monks. He reached Madhya Pradesh to debate Mandana Misra. There he introduced himself as a ""Dravida-Shishu"". This term was alien to Mandan Misra and his wife(who was mediating the debate) so he explained that Dravida-Shishu simply means the child of the triangular land i.e. the southern peninsula of India.
