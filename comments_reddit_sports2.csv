0,g9wws4u,Dusty is the most clutch AFL player ever always shows up for finals. 3x Norm Smith is definitive
1,g9wwppa,And a prime time Thanksgiving game
2,g9wwmf8,"That's actually the name of a supermarket chain in Pittsburgh. Except it's usually pronounced ""Jahn Iggle""."
3,g9wwcj7,"It’s the first regular season football game I’ve watched in 6 years. I still bitch about the commercials like crazy, but I enjoyed the game nonetheless."
4,g9wvv6b,Can someone explain to me why they are punching the ball?
5,g9wvgy9,"People acting like this is a given because there is nothing else on sure didn't pay attention to the NBA playoff ratings this year.

People don't watch the NFL because there is nothing else on, people would watch the NFL regardless.

P.S. The 2020 world series is the lowest rated of all time, the NFL is just a juggernaut."
6,g9wvfhu,"I dont know if you know this, but we're in a pandemic that fist fucked every league's schedule. THIS is now the time with the least sports. Thanks for tuning in"
7,g9wvel6,"Does... Does it have rules? Like, comprehensible rules? Or would that just ruin it?"
8,g9wv9td,"
“He was out before he hit the ground.” Matter of fact."
9,g9wv3zk,"Ted Lasso really has turned things around there, huh?"
10,g9wuxwn,Oct 2nd 1920?
11,g9wuulr,"No, its a poorly designed image that does not look like a ball and instead looks like a hyphen.    


Id love to show you how it looks on mobile, but idiots like you are not worth any additional time."
12,g9wueci,That’s a broken arm.
13,g9wudku,World Series ratings
14,g9wt844,"So I wasn’t completely wrong?! He definitely gained some internet fame, mostly cause he’s actually really likable in how he throws it back, Robin Williams-esque. Not to mention both catches (ball and glove)."
15,g9wt2tk,What would give AFL players the advantage over rugby or American football players? Not saying your wrong I’m just unfamiliar with the game
16,g9wsp6v,How many watched the jags dolphins thursday game tho
17,g9wsp1y,"LOL thats the worst argument I've ever heard considering AFL play is minimal compared to sports like NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL."
18,g9wsg4c,Better than the stupid debate.
19,g9wseyk,Pretty sure people who say this have never actually had sex or eaten pizza
20,g9wsdsg,People like watching train wrecks.
21,g9wsd1u,The top paid Ironman is a woman and she makes less then the average AFLer. I would suggest if Ironman are such good athletes then they would make a better career choice.
22,g9ws8tf,"My understanding is that in the 60’s and 70’s most Owners and GMs didn’t care about their games broadcasted outside of their area, Tex Schram however did, and any state that didn’t have a pro team he’d sign broadcasting rights with local affiliations to broadcast Cowboy games and that’s a big part of how their fan base grew so large, that and Captain Comeback Roger Staubach."
23,g9ws0b6,I miss the days when nobody gave a shit about football
24,g9wrvfg,Not chance not at a high level anyway
25,g9wrr1t,Didn’t Billy Slater prove that NRL athletes were all round better athletes in that Ironman show a few years ago?
26,g9wrq7l,Was a good game though. Carson Wentz is fun to watch. Although I wouldn’t want/trust him to be my qb but yea good game
27,g9wrlto,It looks like he scored a decent amount of tries in the NRL?
28,g9wrfqi,Browns
29,g9wrf3c,The new york jets have entered the conversation
30,g9wr9ym,"Misspelled cricket.  

Fair dinks, what else do you do with a cricket oval in winter?"
31,g9wr8jz,Ah a gentlemen I see.
32,g9wr2go,I would say AFL players are the best all round athletes in the world. Top of the line Fitness and Strength
33,g9wqx1s,"It was like ""wow! That was a fucked up play... Wonder if the other team can top that?"" And it kept going... Like a car accident about to happen, you can't turn away! Entertaining nonetheless..."
34,g9wquxu,This or watch two incredibly old outdated and out of touch white dudes trying not to fall asleep while standing up.
35,g9wqumg,"The word to use is ""barrack"".  Two R's btw."
36,g9wqt4j,"Even then, what a lucky corner to choose!"
37,g9wqs4x,At least NE fans have something to be arrogant about. (Not that you should ever be arrogant about what team you like to watch). Half the cowboys fans have never seen them win a playoff game.
38,g9wqpsx,Only because they were the only game on
39,g9wqn88,An afl’er could do an Ironman but an Ironman has no sporting skills
40,g9wplat,Its purely used to describe the fact its the championship game to Americans who don't know what the Grand Final is. Its not to compare the two. Don't be so uptight
41,g9wpf3a,Ah...
42,g9wpf3c,Presumably they just figured it would be a good corner for watching - you can see how you'd get some great photos of them coming around.
43,g9wothc,*Cleveland Browns have entered the chat*
44,g9wosyr,"Giants are really on that level? Wow. I knew the Eagles have a strong base, Cowboys was an obvious one too. For the longest time the Patriots have felt like a heavyweight team. Giants is a bit of a surprise. Steelers/Packers/Bears give me that long history and large fan base feel too. TIL"
45,g9wop1c,Damn. When you put it like that 
46,g9wonpx,Ill never forget when he started commentating and everyone was so surprised he was calling out every play before it happened... like are you that surprised?
47,g9wolnj,Browns.
48,g9wok7c,You should probably say 100k in the stadium itself because there usually is 1 to 2 other stadiums packed of spectators watching it on the big screen who couldn’t get tickets. It’s a pretty monstrous event for a country of our size
49,g9wnr6x,That’s like 3 times in the last 4 years
50,g9wng9s,It was either that or the presidential debate. Both were equally cringe worthy
51,g9wncmf,Gets a 100k easy every normal year and is usually most watched tv event in Australia statistically.
52,g9wn9vr,Well it gets a 100k easy every normal year and is the most watched tv event in Australia pretty much every year.
53,g9wn3o8,Never underestimate the value of tankbowl
54,g9wmz36,"Totally forgot you guys existed. I honestly cannot remember the last time I’ve seen a Bengals game, and my town had a few people get drafted by them."
55,g9wmuwk,It gets a 100k easy every normal year. It's Australia's super bowl.
56,g9wmhs7,Horney big bois rooting each other and woman whilst being married
57,g9wmdp0,Melbourne cup?
58,g9wmboc,Ironman ?
59,g9wm7jx,Sorry for your loss.
60,g9wloyg,"Do, do I tell them the milk wasn't bad?"
61,g9wlegq,"Over the last 3 games against the AB, the Boks are 1-1-1 with a win and a draw with both happening in (arguably the hardest Stadium in the world for a visiting team to win in) Eden Park. If anything the Boks are closing the gap on the ABs."
62,g9wkzqh,That’s metro area. The 18 million includes people in three different states. Dude was probably talking city proper.
63,g9wkq37,"You mean summer? Because middle of summer, July, when only mlb baseball is on is the least sportsfilled time. Fall has baseball and the beginning of basketball for college and nba usually in addition to two popular groups (college and nfl) of football."
64,g9wkow8,Australia’s super bowl....are you fucken serious??
65,g9wknt6,It does make you wonder if the NFL should move more games to other weeknights.
66,g9wklgc,Yup. I was celebrating that catch for sure. I don’t even like the eagles haha
67,g9wkd2h,Yeah I know you were joking but I thought I'd explain it I only learned of it in the last couple months and I've followed the sport my entire life.
68,g9wkcgw,There was one major live event...
69,g9wk27n,"Primetime is the evening , every evening. It is prime because most people are off work, at home and haven't gone to bed yet."
70,g9wjve2,"Fantasy, DFS, Survivor (suicide) leagues give me some form of interest in just about every nfl game."
71,g9wjubx,I’d rather watch my Giants embarrass themselves than watch Trump embarrass my country.
72,g9wjh4l,Beyond lucky.  Defense dominated.  Wentz well just Wentz it up as usual.
73,g9wj94p,Spam account
74,g9wj7oo,Video won’t play. Georestricted
75,g9wj3u5,Sounds like the coach didn't do his job instilling that.
76,g9wj11w,"Try being there...one moment everyone was throwing their beers in the air, the next we are all soaked on beer and sad."
77,g9wiyiz,Joke's on them. They peaked in high school.

79,g9wibjg,Thanks for the explanation. It was pretty interesting. But I was just joking lol.
80,g9wi90l,It *is* a football shape though. Idk why people are saying it's just a dot or a dash when it's neither.
81,g9wi5j6,"If the Cowboys lose by 40, it's not enough."
82,g9wi20v,Low-key is such a dumb internet buzzword
83,g9whqch,"Jeez, you’re so ignorant it’s hilarious... soccer has been the biggest youth sport in America for a while now. It’s common for kids to start because it’s safe and easy to play. Also, only liking 4 sports and not being considered a sports fan is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard."
84,g9whnsn,"My biggest wish for Australian sport is that we could see sports the way the Americans do. There’s no competition between the sports there. I wish we could all love AFL, NRL and the A-League equally, the way that they see their big4"
85,g9whjn6,Even my sucky Cowboys can still draw big ratings.
86,g9wgjig,It's the only game on. It started out ok then devolved into what I expected; a fight between two bad teams.
87,g9wgjb5,"I'd say we don't really have one. There's no single sporting event that the whole nation rallies behind like the Americans do for the Super Bowl. A lot of NRL fans don't give a shit about AFL and a lot of AFL fans don't give a shit about NRL. 

I think the only event the entire nation gets behind is the Ashes, but that's hardly comparable to a Super Bowl either."
88,g9wggho,That is me at night when I desperately have to pee but don´t look at the way to the toilet
89,g9wgab6,How come the crowd knew which corner (out of god knows how many there are in every stage) the pace notes were wrong?
90,g9wfxf9,Australia's super bowl is a bit rich
91,g9wfqad,Fittest athletes on the planet
92,g9wfmfv,Oh ya based on his top speed this play. Guaruntee he isnt the fastest qb though
93,g9wf547,Only Ten million watched that game.
94,g9weybu,U got very very lucky
95,g9wex0q,Ton of targets and basically nothing of you rage away the long 40 yarder. Happy I didn’t start him
96,g9wes1m,How bored are you if you are now on Reddit commenting on it. Pretty sad
97,g9weqbq,Lols...try Lions on for size. No discussion necessary since the tragedy remains ongoing.
98,g9wekkt,Lucky lucky at the end or it would have been a shitty day for him
