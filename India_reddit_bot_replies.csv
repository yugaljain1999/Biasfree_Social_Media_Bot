Not like this is the first time people in high positions have faced discrimination from temples to workplaces places due to their caste. A CM of a state faced it. District Magistrates have faced it. Judges have faced it and I have seen casteism in private IT companies as well. You can find enough evidence online to show how systemic discrimination is.

Look, I am not going to be surprised one bit if you don't barge from your position of self denial regardless because I have seen enough people like that around who will pretend everything is fine even as they see discrimination going on around them or in some cases participate in it. So, I am not going to give a rats ass about what you think.

As far as I am concerned, I support the system because of all the discrimination I have seen against people from these communities. There is nothing unfair about it. SC+ST+OBC represent 70% of the population and they get 49.5% representation through reservations. Some people have a problem with that because unlike in the past, they longer get the privilege to have all the cake to themselves and the system their ancestors created is biting them now.","tensor([], device='cuda:0', size=(0, 363), dtype=torch.int64)"

>b) hounding ""activists"".

Stan Swamy, Umar Khalid, Prashant Kanojia off the top of my mind are people who shouldn't be treated the way they were treated. There are many other reporters, photographers, and activists who've been in jail for daring to speak up. Even Amnesty International didn't deserve to be hounded out of the country.

I used to be in a boarding school in 6th grade, and the guy who used to be in the bunk bed above mine was a pretty feminine fellow - He used to do girly stuff(with another friend of his, who was also similar) when all the other guys played during play time, had a voice that was pretty mellow, and was quite meek - People (including me, I must shamefully admit) used to call him a hijra (not the exact word, the equivalent euphemism in the local language), but he never used to complain. 

Anyways, I moved away after 6th standard, and couldn't retain contact with him, or anyone else. Almost forgot his name.
