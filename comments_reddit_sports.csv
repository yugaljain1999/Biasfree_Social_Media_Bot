0,g9w9pu2,"This isn’t really our super bowl lol, the majority of the teams in the league come from the one state."
1,g9w94fy,"I feel so attacked right now, since I watched the office then switched over to see some of the debate. I didn’t even realize the Eagles were playing that night"
2,g9w8s8u,Because Tom Wills was a wizard
3,g9w8f7b,Thank you...?
4,g9w7tga,[Sam Simpson](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theroar.com.au/afl/video/sickening-scenes-as-sam-simpson-gets-knocked-out-by-his-own-teammate-1099491/amp/) also concussed in the same game. Much more brutal
5,g9w7pj0,As a giants fan I agree. Terrible game. Just the fucking pits.
6,g9w7o4o,"All I know is I put my faith in Boston Scott on two of my fantasy teams - one decimated by injury and the other being the week where I had 4 different players on bye and he did not disappoint. Granted it took until the final minute of the game to make his pick up from the waiver look like a genius move, but the end result is still the same - I’m alive and well in both of those leagues. Richard Rodgers was not a bad emergency pick up at TE when Ertz went down."
7,g9w7d50,Woke nba finals got 5 million.
8,g9w6h13,wat?
9,g9w68uk,Does that really matter though? The Montreal Canadiens have they most Stanley cup wins and haven’t won since 93. The maple leaves are 3rd and haven’t won in 53 years. It’s pretty irrelevant how many championships a team has won.
10,g9w5z5q,cos it's magical brah
11,g9w5p9x,How many people would have normally eat chef?
12,g9w5cm8,What does that even mean?
13,g9w52bi,Crazy that the teams with some of the largest football markets in the US have so many people watching. What could possibly explain these numbers?
14,g9w51yj,"Do not get into card collecting because you want to make a profit, because you will lose out. Stop inflating prices for those that actually care about the cards themselves =)"
15,g9w4mb4,"Just as often, it will equate to 0 viewers."
16,g9w4f7o,Why the fuck does an Ozzie rules pitch look like a quidditch pitch?
17,g9w489q,"Never seen a game before.  This is very watchable.

10/10 would again in a global pandemic."
18,g9w3lgi,"because it's like asking why someone would jump into the air when happy or high five someone.

&#x200B;

It's just part of a certain culture, and it's connected to emotions. There is no logic behind it, like most things with human emotions and idiosincrasys."
19,g9w0qz3,Yeah so bad
20,g9vzsoc,Up the Tigers
21,g9vzru3,Fuckin rough
22,g9vz617,Start a season 0-25 sometime and you’ll have my admiration
23,g9vypuj,I for one welcome our giant Eagle overlords

25,g9vxo6c,"I’ve had follow my fathers team and suffer until now - carn the Tigers!

This is the way."
26,g9vxcl7,"Poor cunt, has his house lit on fire last night, and knocked out in the first 10 minutes."
27,g9vx7hu,"Nope.  Nothing to see here,  if anything a free kick."
28,g9vwsi4,Brutal! I saw that
29,g9vwjwq,"The toilet bowl already exists. This is literally the industry, you have to know what games and teams to watch to get a constant flow of toilet bowl action.

Look out for the teams opposite of the traditional league, the ones who aren’t looking to goto the super bowl. The more involved you are with this side the more politics you have to deal with, so they balanced it by doing the opposite, it’s an underground niche"
30,g9vwf0f,"Chicks Soccer players are ""cute little white girls""? Nah I've seen a few heifers out there."
31,g9vw147,There should be a rule that QBs drafted in the top 10 get at least one stud OL to hide behind.  Call it the David Carr rule
32,g9vw0mu,DOG SHOT
33,g9vvylm,"The best. A lot of people don’t know it but the underdog niche is where you see true guts play out. It’s a underground secret in the industry to end up at this specific point! You get the real football, not the advertising antics!"
34,g9vvsyh,"Given what Queensland has done for the game this year, I think they deserved it. I’ve been to the Adelaide oval a few times since the redevelopment and it is one of the best places to watch football in the country"
35,g9vv8ip,Yeah I'm going for Richmond but seeing Ablett go down in the first few minutes was shit. Glad he's back out there.
36,g9vv4g7,You misspelled Detroit
37,g9vv2zp,Cheers! Fuck I hope Ablett gets a last premiership.
38,g9vuyzx,Vlaustin for Richmond and he's out and Ablett dislocated his shoulder but he's back on.
39,g9vute3,"Just become a PSG fan or a Celtic fan, your life will 8nstantly improve"
40,g9vuqvm,"If I knew the Cowboys were going to lose 70-0, I’d tape the game and watch it over and over."
41,g9vudys,Vikings know amazing foreplay with no climax
42,g9vu59j,Who got knocked out and how? Turned this on late.
43,g9vtlas,Giant eagles?!?!? That’s sound terrifying
44,g9vtgyh,The constant cycle of slowly building a good team over a few seasons and the systematically destroying it in one offseason. We live in sports pain.
45,g9vt82d,Wet and scrappy but should be a good game
46,g9vsr0d,Coulda had it in Adelaide where I am 
47,g9vslo9,"They had to move it to a different stadium in a different state due to COVID. It was supposed to be at the MCG in Victoria, but because Victoria is the most affected state, they had to move to it to the Gabba in Queensland"
48,g9vra8u,Especially when there is no competition lined up with it.
49,g9vqzrh,Also they should have been used to take the ring to mordor
50,g9vqd7d,Game was very enjoyable.
51,g9vq1da,"When you’re talking to Australians, never say you’re “rooting” for a team. That word means something completely different here. If you want some backstory, Richmond Tigers have won 2 of the last 3 championships and have the best player in the league, Dustin Martin. Geelong Cats won championships in 2007, 09 and 11 and still have some players from that era. They have lost 3 or 4 semi finals since then. Geelong have a player called Gary Ablett who is playing his last game. He is in the GOAT conversation, however is not as good as he once was"
52,g9vpr9w,And people wonder why I’m a Texans fan
53,g9vpj60,"Not sure who to root for or who's playing, but go teams go"
54,g9vp595,If he lives through the season. Our line is so bad he might retire.

58,g9vocfi,"He didn’t trip, he is legs gave out. Happens to a lot of people who don’t practice sprinting"
59,g9vneul,I’m a Philly fan living in New York. All the Giant fans have left are batteries being thrown at Santa 40 years ago.
60,g9vn602,One of them is arguably the GOAT in his last game

63,g9vmmir,"Hi r/sports!

It’s the AFL Grand Final and we’d love to see any of you who are curious or keen to know a bit more about one of our favourite Aussie pastimes. Feel free to drop by the thread and say hi, or r/AFL proper :)

Any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask!"
64,g9vksa4,well I think this play is called a 'bootleg' so he had the opportunity and took it...
65,g9vkklu,the person who threw the dildo on the field did that
66,g9vkbhh,Yeah I looked at the team records and decided catching up on sleep was a better use of my time lol
67,g9vjx6s,Thanks man
68,g9vjohr,"We just had a conversation about how there should be a ""toilet bowl"" (working title) where the bottom ranked teams play for the 1st round draft pick. The Super Bowl has been pretty boring for the last few years. But the bottom ranked teams will be more interesting to watch because it will be more chaotic and the outcome harder to predict.

And then it could be like a Mardi Gras in the stands where people wear funny costumes and just kind of get made fun of by the announcers. Turn it into an irreverent bacchanal of bottom-feeding and sub-optimal football.

A game like baseball, when played at the highest level (a no-hitter), is basically two guys playing catch for 3 hours. But if the teams both have flaws and weaknesses there will be more action on the field. The same goes for NFL. Two teams who don't have the best defense will have more touchdowns. Two teams with ""pretty good"" quarterbacks will throw interceptions and get sacked."
69,g9vjnjw,"Shoot, and I thought it was going to be a show about my Pittsburgh grocery store."
70,g9vizb4,"You complain about no ones informed but you want to see Biden in a nonscripted scenario? Jesus, you fell for that dribbling Biden shit? How uninformed can you be?"
71,g9vi1cp,Football = Pizza.
72,g9vho3q,I don’t know football isn’t that still good? They get to move that close to the scoring zone?
73,g9vhgj8,It was a great fucking game didnt care. Divisional football is highest chance for a great game
74,g9vgn4r,It’s like watching the finals of a recreational league. It’s ain’t high quality football from an absolute standpoint but at least the teams are competitive with each other.
75,g9vd9pb,Fantasy Football too
76,g9vd5nv,One television in a bar should approximate to about 10-20 people
77,g9vd4im,They don't say it bounces between NFC-Beast to NFC-Least for nothing...
78,g9vctc3,49ers-Packers last year was entertaining (I’m definitely not a 49ers fan). But yeah I agree if you have two equally bad teams it’s gonna be a slugfest of good ol football
79,g9vchn4,"Daniel Jones' trip was absolutely worth it! Up there with the ""butt fumble""."
80,g9vc61o,That’s why you never give up on any play. Ever.  Chase them until you hear that whistle
81,g9vb36f,"I’m a huge football fan. I watched most of the first quarter and turned it off. It WAS a terrible game lol

It’s dumb to me that that awful game dwarfed the nba finals in ratings. Idk why basketball has lost the momentum it had during the warriors rise"
82,g9vatho,2011 world series. 1 strike away. Twice
83,g9vapuf,Atlanta Falcons checking in!
84,g9v9kv7,No different than people ogling a car crash on the freeway.
85,g9v8jn7,He got tackled by Aaron Hernandez
86,g9v89jt,So that week in November the SEC wusses out then pounds their chest about how they are great?
87,g9v71t4,And both “bad” teams are made up of the top one percent of football players in the country and some of the best athletes in the world.
88,g9v6yiw,"Fantasy, gambling, and nothing to watch on Thursday=ratings"
89,g9v6kdk,I was watching WFT v Giants last week and was annoyed when he ran a zone read right around Landon Collins who chased him futilely for 30 yds. This puts it into perspective. Dude has legit wheels.
90,g9v6dif,Been a Jags fan since their inception. Can confirm we’re well acquainted with bad football.
91,g9v5p0m,"He killed a newly wed couple, he then offered a deal to the families of the deceased, the guy's family accepted the deal, but the gal's family didn't (thankfully)...and here we are now."
92,g9v59wm,Keeping it classy my xenophobic friend
93,g9v55hk,I've always said that 2 bad teams make a good game.
94,g9v4vul,AFC East with 3/10 from the Patriots haha
95,g9v3j82,Go igals!
96,g9v2v58,"That game ended up being:

Shit o-line vs. Shit o-line. 

My god, those QBs were scrambling for their lives all night."
97,g9v2ugo,Has any division won a larger fraction of Super Bowls in that time frame?
98,g9v2qpi,What's this now?
99,g9v2ku3,That's the secret to a happy marriage: the Giants and Eagles stinking it up just the right amount.
