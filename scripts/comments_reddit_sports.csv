0,g9qgd6r,That is the most Giants thing ever and I love it.
1,g9qgcmw,"That is the worst feeling in the world during a sprint. When your upper body and lower body get out of sync. You can’t really stop yourself and slowing down means you’re going to fall, so you just flail about until you can slow down enough to get back in sync or fall on your face lol"
2,g9qgcij,Go Sounders!
3,g9qgb9z,I legit thought the same thing. What a shitty icon
4,g9qgadw,Big oof
5,g9qgacb,Tyreek Hill only hit 22.7 on a 80+ yard kick return and he was tied for fastest of the season.
6,g9qg5us,That's Chicago Bears music
7,g9qg5nh,"I honestly think he slows down when he realizes jones is actually faster than he is. And he'd rather look lazy than try his hardest and fail at catching a white quarterback. Kinda can't blame him, lol, but this won't be easy to watch in the DB room when they watch this film together."
8,g9qg4rs,"Man that would have been a great time to go for a strip. Jones had to be tired as shit and a little disoriented, he probably wouldn’t have put up much of a fight to keep the ball."
9,g9qg2vq,"Second-longest. Longest dates back to 1930, 92 yards or something like that"
10,g9qg1yc,I'd be guessing robey-coleman is gonna have a real squeamish time watching this at film on Saturday
11,g9qg00w,"Not sure if sarcasm, but it’s a football to indicate possession."
12,g9qfzcb,Did he get a Td on next drive or settle for field goal
13,g9qfycz,"This was recorded as the fastest run by a quarterback in two years, topping out at like 21.2 miles per hour. He was literally too fast"
14,g9qfy9m,"In the US, good football players are treated like gods, and many of them develop an ego to match. Combine that with youth, dumbassery, and a general F.U. attitude, and you get stuff like this happening.

Hell, even Jerry Rice once did something close to this (holding out the football by his fingers and then dropping it) although he wasn't punished for it like he should have been. The ref was so far back he thought he'd crossed the goal line."
15,g9qfy4u,"Everyone on here knows we'd all be sucking air at the 50. Oh, just me? My bad. Sorry guys I'm a severely in shape redditor."
16,g9qfx74,Good effort but came up short
17,g9qfwqr,r/menwritingwomen is the closest comparison I can think of off the top
18,g9qfvmx,Does he get credit for the tackle?
19,g9qfves,[I'm coming babylegs! I'm... regularlegs!](https://youtu.be/-o0Qp5J_Oo8)
20,g9qfuuj,I swear you can hear the people at the game laughing near the end.
21,g9qftaw,The opposite of Forrest Gump.
22,g9qfsgr,Bears fan here. I can’t believe they’re 5-1. They look like shit
23,g9qfs6j,The turf monster go him goood on that play
24,g9qfpz9,Because he is referring to the video of the thread you are commenting on. Lieutenant Dan(iel Jones).
25,g9qfpk6,"No officer, this post is clear."
26,g9qfok9,The ref looks like he's trying not to crack a huge smile while he's explaining the call on the field
27,g9qfnxb,Has this ever happened before? I feel like it hasn't and its fucking hilarious
28,g9qfn4g,"Not everyone can be a Mahomes! /s
Great run though, very impressed!"
29,g9qfm8x,That’s not a trip. That’s a I’m going faster than I can actually go
30,g9qfllz,Your dad sounds like an asshole
31,g9qfld3,"Or the opposite, this was the only mistake worth remembering as the rest are forgotten."
32,g9qfksa,"21 and 31 were watching a video?

What are you talking about?"
33,g9qfkr4,"What a dumb cunt.

I love it!"
34,g9qfi5a,"Jokes on you, I never went to public events or was good at anything for people to notice me. :)"
35,g9qfh2i,"I hate to ask but, did ur Utes lose after that?"
36,g9qffqn,Experience NFC East Football.
37,g9qff6n,Mans was running so fast he caught speed wobble.
38,g9qff16,"Take my upvote you ass, just take it."
39,g9qfe03,"He jerks at :14 like he pulls something. Nice run though, for a Qb."
40,g9qf9q3,Lol ‘athlete’
41,g9qf9m7,Calm down.
42,g9qf6uw,I thought they all tested positive
43,g9qf646,I don't even watch football and even I'm cringing. Why the fuck would he rush to drop the ball? So dumb.
44,g9qf5og,Remember last year when they had the downs indicator in all yellow so every down you thought it was a flag?
45,g9qf30m,Giants season summed up in one play
46,g9qexxn,He leg too fast for he gotdamn feet
47,g9qeuar,The man catches.
48,g9qer1n,"Bro catches long pass, runs to score.  Drops the ball behind him like a cocky shit without realizing he wasn't actually in the end zone yet.  So they're celebrating when the other team realizes the ball was technically fumbled.  They just pick up the ball and run the other way.

The action is in the first 30 seconds.  The rest is just analysis and replays."
49,g9qeo4d,Cancel the NFC East
50,g9qemy6,Hes sanic. gotta go fast dad.
51,g9qemrs,"Ey, is that Art\_way?! Dude, I haven't seen you since that time you  jumped a route and picked off the pass in full stride with nothing but 60 yards of green grass in front of you!"
52,g9qemn5,"[This](https://youtu.be/kNHjIDy0aBI) is basically the rugby league version of that (except no try down the other end.)

For context, the ball has to be grounded in rugby for the try to count."
53,g9qekxs,If you don’t like this you don’t like 2020 NFC East football.
54,g9qehs2,a teammate of mine did this. we always manage to fit in tripping over a blade of grass into any conversation
55,g9qehp9,"It doesn't appear that you have read Thinking Fast and Slow or are familiar with behavior economics, which is why you try to simplify a complex and multifactorial issue into a heuristic.

People in general are lazy thinkers and develop mental models, or schema, that they use in order to conserve mental energy. There is nothing wrong with them thinking that I wasn't an American, because I didn't fit their mental models. It's no different than what you or I do, which is to make judgments about things or people that are often wrong. It's blatant hypocrisy, and also a victim mentality, to be upset at others without recognizing it in yourself.

Besides, who cares what others think, unless you want to play the victim card. I sure don't, and in the last 10 years I barely remember anyone asking me where I come from. Why would they? My English communication is better than 99% of Americans, even native English speakers.

You emotions and subjectivity (and self-loathing?) cloud your thinking, which was not that deep to begin with. If you take a step back, 2 things are apparent:

1) Objectively, the poster's statement was not inherently prejudiced 

* In fact, it was a compliment on how well the announcer spoke English despite not being an American native English speaker

* You could make a similar statement for Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine and it would be just as true: ""Wow, that English is fantastic! He has the 'American' voice down perfectly! Besides some very small details, I was completely convinced he was an American.""

* However, your logic is that no one can make any statement about any characteristics of any group of people.

* Calling me an Uncle Tom makes you a hypocrite by your own logic, whether you care or not. Who is to say what a Chinese-American is and how they should act? Regardless of what I do or say, I am a Chinese-American. I don't have to meet certain qualifications to be one.

* At the very least I'm consistent and not a hypocrite. And I don't care in the least whether you levy any personal attacks on me. Why should I? Your perspective is simple and narrow, not reflecting any deep thinking on the topic.

2) People in general are not good communicators

* The guy was trying to communicate something, which is that the announcer speaks very good English for someone who is not a native English speaker.

* Most people are imprecise communicators. As an example, it's common to see people use notorious, infamous, and renowned as substitutes for one another, whereas notorious and infamous have negative connotations and renowned has a positive connotation.

* I was a management consultant at an MBB, the most prestigious consulting firms that accept less than 1% of applicants. I regularly counseled C-suite executives, SVPs, and VPs, and worked with everyone down to the individual contributor level. You would think that executives and elite consultants are good communicators, but almost everyone makes mistakes when communicating ideas.

* Since this is the case, it's best to try to understand what people are communicating, rather than pick out their mistakes. If you hold others to a high standard in communicating, it's almost guaranteed that you will end up looking like a hypocrite.

* That's exactly what happened when you said, ""If you think having an Asian accent doesn't qualify you as American.""	It's clear that you meant to use ""disqualify"" rather than ""doesn't qualify."" I'm surprised you continue to harp on the poster's communication while excusing your own."
56,g9qehoc,">Runs 80 yards in 10 seconds. That’s 24 ft every second. 

>Reddit: hurr durr this guy sucks"
57,g9qeg2f,How tf do you get -7?
58,g9qef60,"Go Cougs

There are dozens of us, dozens!"
59,g9qef3z,"Not sure if you guys have played sports competitively or not, but I’ve always been able to hit 1 or 2 MPH faster when fueled by adrenaline in a game than outside of it.  A run that long that fast was probably too much for his body to actually keep up with."
60,g9qecdr,r/yesyesyesyesno
61,g9qec3l,"You’ll get the gist after the first minute, but basically guy running into the end zone drops the ball at the one yard line thinking he’s in the endzone.  Defense picks it up and runs it all the way back to the other endzone."
62,g9qebvj,He was scared ASF lol. Fox zoomed in his face in the replays
63,g9qe9zb,To be fair if beer tsunami was behind me I'd run this fast. Maybe.
64,g9qe8xn,Not gonna lie the football that shows who has a ball made it look like they had -7 points
65,g9qe8j5,"Ah, the Xavier Rhodes special."
66,g9qe84y,That's the possession indicator - it's shaped like a football.
67,g9qe83q,Running is hard.
68,g9qe7kd,"I never played high school, but played JFL. Always wanted to play RB, but for some reason at probably 5 foot and 150lbs they put me at DE, even though I was the 2nd fastest on the team. Finally one game they decide to let me run a play at RB. Probably 15 degrees out, snow and sleet and in the 3rd qtr. So my arms are already numb. I probably got 50ish yards and a defender comes behind and knocks the ball out my arms. I was devastated, luckily my team was supportive. But I never got a chance again."
69,g9qe63r,That's impossible to know. The next series would have been completely different series with a completely different outcome.
70,g9qe38a,"I thought the same! It's the ball possession graphic. Giants are so bad this year I saw -7 too and just thought ""yeah sounds about right""."
71,g9qe2xg,"I’m so glad I get to link [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/Vwt5AHc)!

Credit to u/porkchop-sandwhiches"
72,g9qe06w,Why does NY have -7 points?
73,g9qdzpe,"You're going to great length to keep acting like 21 was out of the play while were both watching the same video of the guy jogging and giving minimal effort. 

Its not that complex."
74,g9qdykf,I murder the dance floor at weddings when that jam comes on
75,g9qdy85,That makes sense if the NFL wasn’t all about the money
76,g9qdw6i,This is why the Cowboys are still in first place at 2-4.
77,g9qdw3h,Robey-Coleman wasn't even trying
78,g9qduiv,They get paid millions of dollars to do this?
79,g9qdny1,White man can't jump or run from the looks of things.
80,g9qdn7j,You didn’t link anything.
81,g9qdkui,"That’s just not true. Tyreek Hill, who ran a sub-ten second 100m dash in high school, has “only” reached a top speed of 22.6 mph in game. Danny Dimes was flying here."
82,g9qdjj8,Partly because of Rupert Murdoch's Fox News.
83,g9qdinw,I'd pay you a grand to see you do better in the same situation
84,g9qdhxb,"That's not even a trip, he just gave up."
85,g9qdh4r,Scoooo! Go Cougs. Huck the Fuskies.
86,g9qdfk2,I was watching this at my baseball practice I knew this was gonna happen
87,g9qdeg5,208 AD?  They played football back then?
88,g9qde7f,"He fucked up.  He reacted poorly when Jones kept it.  It was a 1v1 play and Evan Engram was totally all over him.  It was a great play call.

But that doesn't answer my question:

>> But where the heck was 21 (safety in cover 1)????

If the safety wasn't off doing something else, that's a 20-yard-run...not 80."
89,g9qddpa,"I have no idea where my 1 went, but 208 is 1812 years ago."
90,g9qdcwe,Easiest thing to do would be for the NFL to have a win minimum. Automatic playoff berth for division winners unless the finish below .500
91,g9qdby2,Damn 1800 years ago? That’s a while jeez
92,g9qdbla,He graduated the year before. It’s absurd.
93,g9qd8c2,How the fuck do you get to negative points in NFL??
94,g9qd5o7,I’m an Oregon native and watched that in real time. Blew my mind. So fucking pathetic.
95,g9qd43a,Blocked out? Hes jogging while he can still make the play.
96,g9qd2er,Hell yeah
97,g9qd211,51-27 Ducks.
98,g9qd1pa,I thought the score was negative 7 to 10.
99,g9qczjx,"He went 21.23 mph, Lamar Jackson's fastest in game speed ever was 21.01 mph lol"
