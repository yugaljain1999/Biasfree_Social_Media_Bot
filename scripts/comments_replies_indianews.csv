2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.

>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.

They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”

>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

Even leftist(\*The print) media actually have realised this issue

>  
**One**, it is only for Hindu temples that the government wishes to ensure proper administration and its income used for ‘correct’ purposes.  
>  
>**Two**, contributions made to Hindu temples is used by the commissioner uses to fund various government programmes.  
>  
>**Three**, temple collections are not used to set up *ved pathshalas* and educational institutions for teaching Indian philosophy and tradition.  
>  
>**Four**, Subramaniam Swamy [wrote](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece), “The Srirangam Ranganathat Temple paid the government a fee of Rs 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’, for employees rendering religious services like reciting Vedas, Pasurams during the deity processions, no salary is paid. They get offerings made by devotees and share in sale of *archana* tickets”.  
>  
>**Five**, temple property has de-facto become pseudo-government property. According to T.R. Ramesh, President, Temple Worshippers Society Chennai – “Between 1986 and 2005 Tamil Nadu temples simply ‘lost’ 47,000 acres of land and currently more than 10 million square feet of valuable sites belonging to Hindu Temples in Tamil Nadu are under encroachment.”  
>  
>He adds, “In Tamil Nadu temples have over 478,000 plus acres of land, 2.44 cr sq feet of property for which the TN HR & CE department gets only Rs 58 crs p.a. In reality income from all temples, mutts would, on a conservative basis generate Rs 6,000 cr p.a.”  
>  
>**Six**, idols from ancient temples, part of India’s heritage, [go missing.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/fence-that-eats-the-crop-government-running-hindu-temples-is-another-anomaly-indias-selective-secularism-fosters/) In any well-managed organisation, those responsible would be held accountable and punished, but not in the government.  
>  
>**Seven,** government interference has interrupted the ancient lineage of priesthood.  
>  
>**Eight**, when the government controls any institution, political interference, patronage and corruption invariably seep in.

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

3061,g9jd1xy,Denial?
3062,g9jccyu,It’s abominable that the government has control over and taxes Hindu temples in an 80% Hindu populated nation and levys no tax on mosques or churches. Absolute shitbaggery that blows my mind every day. If secularism is the fabric of our constitution then why is the religious majority the one always being shit on?
3063,g9jc88w,Much respect to Sir J Sai Deepak!
3064,g9j9df2,Against freedom of speech. Against nation.
3065,g9j6ea2,Are you considering? Oh *please* don't do it!!

3086,g9iwsrp,"Why senior most BJP leader @EknathGKhadse left the BJP?
1. Khadse was the chief minister aspirant & as a senior most BJP leader he claimed in CM post, but BJP chose his junior Devendra Fadnavis as CM in 2014 (1)

2. Khadse was forced to resign as a minister over Pune land and other issue. Khadse felt that there was deliberate conspiracy by erstwhile CM Devendra Fadnavis to cut to size him & destroy his 40 years political career. He expected central BJP leadership will help him but in vain

3. Khadse says injustice was done with him despite working for the BJP for 40 years & he waited for the justice patiently for last five years , but no one helped him. In 2019, Lok Sabha polls, he struggled to get ticket for his daughter in law.

4. In 2019, Khadse was denied ticket for state assembly election. His daughter Rohini Khadse lost the state polls by few number of votes. It was big set back to Khadse.

5. Khadse was promised MLC, then governor and nomination for Rajya Sabha but nothing was done. Khadse had huge hope from his past party but he was sidelined.

6. In home distinct of Khadse , BJP tried to make an alternative leadership through Girish Mahajan, Khadse's junior Mahajan was promoted on every forum while Khadse was systematically ignored that widened gap between Fadnavis and Khadse and it ended Khadse leaving BJP permanently"

3091,g9itroo,"Half of the BJP MLAs are imports from Khangress party who joined so that they can get easy access to power on the back of Modi.

Now with UT snatching power under the feet of Cucknavis, there will be more desertions and BJP will reduce to a party of Gujjews and Naarth Endians."

if we're tolerant with umar khalids , Swara bhaskars, terror sympathizers & separatists, we're basically letting terrorists speak for& mobilize all minorities. This oppression industry needs to end, the fake SJW left should no longer be acknowledged. We need to go the macron way & seriously take action on radical elements."

3105,g9imz5o,This seems more like a plan rather than corruption.

Modi can't do anything unless he's sure that all of us would support him unconditionally, as long as he remains true to our cause.
